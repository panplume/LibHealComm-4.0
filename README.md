# LibHealComm-4.0 for Endless TBC (3.3.5 custom client)

![LHC4 in Grid2](/LHCGrid2.png)

First working modification to have it (incoming health prediction) working for Endless TBC.

TODO: Druid Healing Touch not showing up in some condition (rank 5+). Tranquility and Prayer of Healing not showing (may miss code to support this).
